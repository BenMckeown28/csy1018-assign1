# Benjamin McKeown -CSY1018 Assignment 1- Student Number 16424393

# csy1018-assign1

During the assignment, I have discussed and asked rasing questions between two other students who live in my flat:
Alfie England
Brook smith
These questions included content about the design briefs requirements and restrictions which we needed to follow.
I also have been to a couple of the support sessions to ask Tom Rose about some problems I was having with some of the media queries for specific pages of my website.
### Hours spent:

On average I spent around 35+ hours on the assignment, but it’s too difficult to give an exact figure because there were times when I had to research for specific code.

Designs and wireframes are subject to be edited to suit user need, for now it’s a general idea of what it will look like.

#Work Log

## 13th November
Today I started the assignment and began to do the initial commit through Gitbash, for today all I have done is set up all the files within the repository.

## 21st November

Began starting to set up the navigation menu so that it has the content of the links between the different pages, also I created the logo and included it
within the design of the navbar.

##22nd November
I then began starting to develop the menu being responsive, for now as the user drags the navigation bar smaller in the horizontal direction, the text within the
navbar will get smaller.
 I also replaced the house Icon so that it was simpler to recognise.
 I also added content to the index page of the website
##23rd November
 I started to create the content for the footer of the website, this included the social links/icons and the copyright statement to say that it was developed
by me also I coded the background of the footer as well to match the rest of the colour scheme within the website.
 I began trying to use basic media quires to try and change the format of some of the content on the index page.
I began to try and make the footer more responsive in terms of desktop use by adding attributes to the <a> tags of the footer.
##24th November
I made some changes to the navigation bar so that it was more responsive and easier to use.
##28th November
Added some more media quires to make the website more responsive, only for desktop use still.
##29th November
Decided to change the font style to Vmin instead of pixels, the reason was because while I was trying to work out media quires it makes it a lot easier to work with.
##1st December
I then started to add links to the different web pages through the navigation bar, this made it easier to code the different pages of the website at the same time.
## 3rd December
 I then started to add the content of the CV page with the use of html
Then I used CSS to style this page so it began to look more like a CV.
## 5th December
I realised that the positioning of the skills part of the CV was slightly out of place, and so fixed it by changing the padding.
## 7th December
I then decided to add content and style it through CSS to the Biography page, I kept all the styling of all the other page’s headers and footers.
## 8th December
I added all the content to the Contact page and styled it, I gave the icons on the page animations also.
## 10th December
I decided to change all the sizing of the font and the padding to em instead of having it as Vmin. I also added media queries to the index page for the header and the footer.
## 12th December
I redesigned the Cv page of the website in more of a centralised format to make it simpler to read, also I changed the media queries for this so it suits the new design. I also added some media queries to the bio gallery page where the images automatically change the display when minimised. I also started to develop the media queries for the home page of the web page.
## 15th December
I added more media queries to the rest of the page so that its more responsive to desktop use.
##16th December
I decided to change the colour of most of the content of the web pages so that they suit the material design specification.
##19th December
I updated the media queries for the index, Cv and bio page so that its fully compatible through mobile devices. I decided to get rid of some of the content in the footer as it was not needed and was serving problems with the formatting of the resizing of the web page.
##11 January
I decided to make the form of the contact page bigger so that it was easily viewable to all users. The form has media queries associated with it so it can be used on mobile or minimised desktop view.
