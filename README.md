## Navigation diagrams
! [Navigation diagram] (navigation.png)
## 13th November
Today I started the assignment and began to do the initial commit through Gitbash, for today all I have done is set up all the files within the repositry.
## 21st November
Began starting to set up the navigation menu so that it has the content of the links between the different pages, also I created the logo and included it
within the design of the navbar.
##22nd November
I then began starting to develop the menu being responsive, for now as the user drags the navigation bar smaller in the horizontal direction, the text within the
navbar will get smaller.
 I also replaced the house Icon so that it was simpler to recognise.
 I also added content to the index page of the website
##23rd November
 I started to create the content for the footer of the website, this included the social links/icons and the copyright statement to say that it was developed
by me also I coded the background of the footer as well to match the rest of the colour scheme within the website.
 I began trying to use basic media quires to try and change the format of some of the content on the index page.
I began to try and make the footer more responsive in terms of desktop use by adding attributes to the <a> tags of the footer.
##24th November
I made some changes to the navigation bar so that it was more responsive and easier to use.
##28th November
Added some more media quires to make the website more responsive, only for desktop use still.
##29th November
Decided to change the font style to Vmin instead of pixels, the reason was because while I was trying to work out media quires it makes it a lot easier to work with.
##1st December
I then started to add links to the different web pages through the navigation bar, this made it easier to code the different pages of the website at the same time.
## 3rd December
 I then started to add the content of the CV page with the use of html
Then I used CSS to style this page so it began to look more like a CV.
## 5th December
I realised that the positioning of the skills part of the CV was slightly out of place, and so fixed it by changing the padding.
## 7th December
I then decided to add content and style it through CSS to the Biography page, I kept all the styling of all the other pageâ€™s headers and footers.
## 8th December
I added all the content to the Contact page and styled it, I gave the icons on the page animations also.
## 10th December
I decided to change all the sizing of the font and the padding to em instead of having it as Vmin. I also added media queries to the index page for the header and the footer.
## 12th December
I redesigned the Cv page of the website in more of a centralised format to make it simpler to read, also I changed the media queries for this so it suits the new design. I also added some media queries to the bio gallery page where the images automatically change the display when minimised. I also started to develop the media queries for the home page of the web page.
## 15th December
I added more media queries to the rest of the page so that its more responsive to desktop use.
